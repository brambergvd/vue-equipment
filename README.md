# Vue Equipment

Our Frontend Toolkit, Free and Open Source.

> “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

Over the years, we have found ourselves facing a common problem: driven by the lack of options in the Vue ecosystem, we needed to implement solutions from the ground-up, over and over again. Vue Equipment is our attempt to solve this. It is essentially a collection of ready-to-use plugins and composables for building modern web applications.
