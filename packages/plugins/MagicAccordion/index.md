      <magic-accordion-content>
        <div class="w-[20rem]">
          Card tricks captivate audiences with sleight of hand, misdirection,

      <magic-accordion-content>
        <div class="w-[20rem]">
          Illusions in magic rely on optical tricks and hidden mechanisms,
          making spectators question reality and marvel at the magicianâ€™s
          seemingly supernatural skills.

      </magic-accordion-content>
    </magic-accordion-view>

        <div class="w-[20rem]">

          stunts.
