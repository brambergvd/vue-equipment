# Introduction

### Our Frontend Toolkit, Free and Open Source

Vue Equipment is a collection of ready-to-use plugins and composables for building modern web applications. It comes unstyled, with a flexible, yet opiniated API. It’s fully typed and can be integrated in both Vue and Nuxt.

## Vision

Over the years, we have found ourselves facing a common problem: driven by the lack of options in the Vue ecosystem, we needed to implement solutions from the ground-up, over and over again. Vue Equipment is our attempt to solve this.

While projects like [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) and various [Nuxt modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) have recently closed the gap to the arguably superior React ecosystem, we feel that there is still some catching up to do.

## Inspiration

Even though we mostly work with Vue, we’ve kept an eye on the React ecosystem and have been massively inspired by projects such as [Sonner](https://github.com/emilkowalski/sonner); [Vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul); [⌘K](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk); [Radix](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives); [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui), and the likes. With Vue Equipment, we hope to finally give back something to the community that has enabled us to earn a living for the past decade.
